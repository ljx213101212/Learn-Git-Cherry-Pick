# Learn-Git-Cherry-Pick

develop/phase1 's new changes

develop/phase2 's new changes:
So basically, What I did is:

1. Init project
2. Create develop/phase1 branch first.
3. And write "develop/phase1 's new changes" in this .md as phase1 changes. 
4. Create develop/phase2 branch.
5. Trying to copy step 3 to develop/phase2 branch. (Not merge, but just copy one commit)
6. Now I push current changes to develop/phase2 branch, and finally cherry-pick to master.
